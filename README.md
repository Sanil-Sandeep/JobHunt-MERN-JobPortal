# JobHunt-MERN-JobPortal

JobHunt is a full-stack job portal application built using ReactJS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The platform provides a seamless experience for users to register, sign in, browse job listings, apply for jobs, and manage their profiles. Users can search for jobs using various filters, view detailed job descriptions, and track the status of their applications in real time. The admin panel enables administrators to create and update company profiles, post job listings, and manage applicant submissions by accepting or rejecting applications. The application ensures secure authentication for both users and admins, while also offering file upload capabilities using Multer for resume submissions. The backend is powered by Express.js, with MongoDB handling data storage, and route protection implemented for enhanced security. On the front end, ReactJS combined with Redux ensures efficient state management, while Vite optimizes the development process with fast builds. This project demonstrates strong full-stack development capabilities, highlighting key skills such as database integration, user authentication, and a responsive, user-friendly interface.
